        "### Python is a multipurpose programming language, and it has applicability pretty much anywhere that uses data, mathematical computation, or lines of code.\n",
        "### Like most programming languages, Python works in tandem with an interpreter that executes the finalized lines of codes. With its basis in English syntax, is considered one of the least fussy and most straightforward coding languages to learn and read.\n",
        "### Can be used for high-level data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many more features that make it as useful for complex application development as it is for scripting or \"glue code\" that connects components. It can also be extended to make system calls to almost all operating systems and to run code written in C or C++. Due to its ubiquity and ability to run on nearly every system architecture, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications.\n",
        "### The programming language includes thousands of third-party modules available in the Python Package Index (PyPI). PyPI provides popular standards for different expertise, like Django for web development and NumPy, Pandas, and Mathplotlib for data science."

        "# **What is python used for?**\n",
        "### Python is a general-purpose programming language, so it can be used for many things. Python is used for web development, AI, machine learning, operating systems, mobile application development, and video games.\n",
        "### The language is used in scientific and mathematical computing, and even in AI projects. It’s been successfully embedded in numerous software products, including visual effects compositor Nuke, 3D modelers, and animation packages.\n",
        "### YouTube, Instagram, and Quora are among the countless sites that use Python. Much of Dropbox’s code in Python, Python has been used extensively by digital special effects house ILM (whose work spans across all of the Star Wars and Marvel films) and it’s a favorite of electronics titan Philips.\n",
        "### One of its biggest advantages is its (relative) simplicity. Python's English-like syntax makes it easy to learn and read, and unlike some other languages, it uses simple line breaks instead of symbols to define code blocks.\n",
        "### Python also helps speed up development, with built-in classes and functions and an extensive selection of libraries that make writing code quicker and easier. Plus, as an interpreted language, you can execute and test your code right after writing it without an intermediate compilation process.\n",
        "### Another advantage Python holds over other languages is its versatility. Python is a portable, cross-platform language — meaning you can write and execute Python code on any operating system with a Python interpreter. With some other languages, you'd have to modify your code for each platform."

        "# **History of python**\n",
        "### It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",
        "### In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherland. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018."

        "### In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several times.\n",
        "### Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.\n",
        "### A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement −\n",

        "### Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.\n",

        "| 1\t| while loop. Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.|\n",
        "| 2\t| for loop. Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable. |\n",

        "| 2 | continue statement. Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. |\n",
        "| 3 | pass statement. The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. |"
